# FallingbrookGameDev2017

**Welcome to Fallingbrook GameDev 2017!**

This repository features Elm and GraphicSVG examples from Fallingbrook GaveDev 2017. Includes prior examples and live content created throughout the day. 

*If you think an example you created would be helpful to other students, pitch it to one of the volunteers present, and we may feature it here!*

## How to Run Examples
To run examples, copy all text from the example you wish into the notebooks numbered 1030-1039 on your MacOutreach Rocks account. Click [here](/Examples) to see all the examples.

**Note: If you wish to start a new example, ensure you are not accidentally overwriting your previous code. You can copy the new example into another one of the 103\* notebooks.**

## Help and Support
Volunteers are here to help you learn how to not only become a great Elm programmer but also a great teacher of Elm and computer science to younger students! If you need help, don't hesitate to ask us in person, or send messages on the MacOutreach Rocks help chat system. This will also be your resource over the coming weeks when you continue to work on your projects and learn at home.
